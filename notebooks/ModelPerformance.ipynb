    "Get ready to put on your data science and ML engineering hats! In the next few lessons, you are going to learn how to evaluate the performance of ML models. Recall that after you train an ML model on past data, you can use that model to make predictions on new or previously unseen data. But how do you know if that model is useful?  In ML, when you hear the phrase \"model performance\", I want you to think about evaluating the quality of model predictions, commonly referred to as its **forecast skill** or **prediction skill**. This first lesson will focus on evaluating predictive modeling in the context of supervised learning, including both classification and regression problems."
